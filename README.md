__Methods__
- Location: laboratory flume
- Flume test section dimensions: 0.46 m x 0.46 m x 6.1 m
- Suspended Sediment type: kaolinite
- Concentration measurement devise: optical backscatter sensor (OBS 3+)
- Grain size measurements: Sieving for bed material, microscope for suspended sediment

A detailed description of the methods can be found in the paper.

__Data__

The directories in this repository contain the following data:
1. __Summary Tables:__ contains the hydraulic conditions for each experimental run (Table 1 of the paper), and the modeled alpha1 values.
2. __Time Dependent Data:__ contains the suspended sediment concentration time series data and data pertaining to the change in the suspended particle size distribution with time. The concentration time series data shows only the data from the time of full mixing and is the average of the upstream and downstream OBS output. Further details can be found in the paper cited above.

The file `Data_Viewer.ipynb` can be used to visualize the data.
